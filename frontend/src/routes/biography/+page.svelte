        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Manuel Nicol√°s Matute Zapata was born in Venezuela in the early 2000s. From a young age, he showed remarkable 
            Nicol√°s was born in Venezuela in the early 2000s. From a young age, he developed a love for computing and had 
            big dreams of leading a major company specializing in robotic assistants (though he admits these were "wild ideas"). 
            As he grew older, he began to appreciate the power of learning‚Äîparticularly the importance of studying things 
            that truly interested him. During his adolescence, he realized he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù and might not be able to 
            solve complex mathematical problems or find the cure for cancer. However, he learned that through discipline 
            and hard work, he could still achieve remarkable things. This realization led him to embrace self-learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to self-learning and the internet, Nicol√°s significantly improved his academic performance, earning the 
            top honor in his high school, graduating with a degree in Computer Science.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing high school, he began to wonder, as many do at that age, what to do with his life. Fortunately, 
            he already knew: he wanted to become a programmer. He started studying Java, the programming language that 
            caught his attention the most, following tutorials on YouTube. Nicol√°s enrolled in the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica 
            de Panam√° to pursue a degree in Software Development, attending until 2022. During that time, he had the chance 
            to teach computer science to elementary school students at Colegio Real de Panam√°, where he gained valuable 
            experience, even though teaching had never been his primary goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most important career opportunities he encountered came when he landed a job as a programmer for 
            Indra in Panama (a Spanish-based company). He worked there for a year and a half, gaining practical experience 
            with modern software development practices, often from the comfort of his home due to the remote nature of the job. 
            Yet, even as a professional programmer, Nicol√°s wasn‚Äôt satisfied and continued learning new programming languages 
            and tools on his own, particularly focusing on improving his English.
        </p>

        <h2>Today</h2>
        <p>
            His hard work paid off when an even more exciting opportunity arose: a remote programming position with a 
            U.S.-based company. Although the prospect of working in English, a language he had never spoken regularly, 
            was intimidating, Nicol√°s decided to go for it. He completed three interviews and secured the job, where he now 
            continues to learn and work in a new language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nicol√°s feels incredibly grateful for both the successes and challenges he has encountered, for the support from 
            his family, for the people he met, and for all the experiences that have shaped him. He looks forward to continuing 
            to grow and explore new opportunities in the future.
        </p>
