        >Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Manuel Nicol√°s Matute Zapata was born in Venezuela in the early 2000s, 2001 to be more specific. 
            From a young age, he developed a strong interest in computers, especially video games. As he grew older, 
            he began to appreciate the value of learning things that truly interested him. During his adolescence, 
            he was an excellent student, but he did not see himself as a "genius."
        </p>
        <p>
            However, even though he did not consider himself a genius, he always stood out for being disciplined and dedicated. 
            Thanks to self-learning and the internet, Nicol√°s consistently achieved strong academic performance, earning the top honor 
            in his high school and graduating with a degree in Computer Science.

        >Career</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing high school, he began to wonder, as many do at that age, what to do with his life. Fortunately, 
            he already knew: he wanted to become a programmer. He started studying Java, the programming language that 
            caught his attention the most, following tutorials on YouTube. Nicol√°s enrolled in the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica 
            de Panam√° to pursue a degree in Software Development, attending until 2022. During that time, he had the chance 
            to teach computer science to elementary school students at Colegio Real de Panam√°, where he gained valuable 
            experience, even though teaching had never been his primary goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most important career opportunities he encountered came when he landed a job as a programmer for 
            Indra in Panama. He worked there for a year and a half, gaining practical experience 
            with modern software development practices, often from the comfort of his home due to the remote nature of the job. 
            Yet, even as a professional programmer, Nicol√°s wasn't satisfied and continued learning new programming languages 
            and technologies on his own.

            md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl xl:text-5xl"
        >Today</h2>
        <p>
            His hard work paid off when an even more exciting opportunity arose: a remote programming position with a 
            U.S.-based company. Although the prospect of working in English, a language he had never spoken regularly, 
            was intimidating, Nicol√°s decided to go for it. He completed three interviews and secured the job, where he now 
            continues to learn and improve in new tools, programming languages and modern software engineering practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nicol√°s feels incredibly grateful for both the successes and challenges he has encountered, for the support from 
            his family, for the people he met, and for all the experiences that have shaped him. He looks forward to continuing 
            to grow and explore new opportunities in the future.
